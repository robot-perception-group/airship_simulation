Installation Instructions - Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install and initialize ROS Melodic desktop full, additional ROS packages, catkin-tools, and wstool:

```console
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full ros-melodic-joy ros-melodic-octomap-ros ros-melodic-mavlink
$ sudo apt install python-wstool python-catkin-tools protobuf-compiler libgoogle-glog-dev ros-melodic-control-toolbox
$ sudo rosdep init
$ rosdep update
$ echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator build-essential
```
2. If you don't have ROS workspace yet you can do so by

```console
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace  # initialize your catkin workspace
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin init
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone -b med18_gazebo9 https://github.com/gsilano/rotors_simulator.git
$ git clone -b med18_gazebo9 https://github.com/gsilano/mav_comm.git
$ git clone git clone https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard
$ git clone https://github.com/ootang2018/blimp_simulation.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
```

and optionally
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ootang2018/AirCap.git

```
you might need to look into github page (https://github.com/ootang2018/AirCap.git) for more installation instruction

3. Build your workspace with `python_catkin_tools` 

```console
$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

4. Add sourcing to your `.bashrc` file

```console
$ echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Basic Usage
----------------------------------------------------------
After installing, you can test with the following commands in a terminal
```console
$ roslaunch blimp_description blimp_with_env.launch  
$ roslaunch blimp_description teleokeyboard.launch 
```
You should see blimp in gazebo environment and be able to fly it via teleokeyboard

To fly with blimp, it is necessary to generate thrust with the rotors, this is achieved by sending commands as follows:
 ```console
$ rostopic pub /blimp/command/motor_speed mav_msgs/Actuators '{angular_velocities: [100, 100, 0]}'
```

To speed up the simulation, a certain set of parameters can be included by varying the flags: 
`enable_meshes` (it enables the mesh of the blimp), `enable_sensors` (it enables the ground truth sensor), `enable_wind_plugin` (external disturbances will be simulated)

These value can be modified before simulating the blimp behavior acting on the launch file:
```console
$ roslaunch blimp_description blimp_with_env.launch enable_meshes:=false
```

Sometimes it is useful to manually set destination or autogenerated destination. The interactive target allows user to specify destinations by draging target in `rviz`

```console
$ roslaunch blimp_description spawn_target
$ rviz
```

blimpRL
----------------------------------------------------------
blimpRL package contains different RL agents. To compile the code, it is required to create a separate catkin workspace that has to be compiled with python3. Therefore, it is also recommended to create virtual environment such as [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to separate into different workspaces. 
```console
$ conda create --"name" python=3
$ conda activate "name"
```

create a catkin workspace and compile with python3
```console
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws_py3/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws_py3/src
$ catkin_init_workspace  # initialize your catkin workspace
$ cd ~/catkin_ws_py3/
$ catkin init
$ cd ~/catkin_ws_py3/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ootang2018/blimpRL
$ cd blimpRL
$ pip install rospkg
$ pip install pyyaml
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ cd ~/catkin_ws_py3
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

After compiling with `catkin_make` and spawn the gazebo environment, it can be tested with
```console
$ roslaunch mbrl_pets training.launch
```
you should be able to see training started


AirCap
----------------------------------------------------------
Finally, if AirCap is installed:
```console
$ cd aircap/script/simulation
$ bash setup_mavocap_gazebo.sh 
```
This will setup blimp with AirCap. Now you should be able to see blimp in Gazebo. You can run `rqt_image_view` in a new console and choose image topic of interest. If a human actor is passed by, a bounding box generated by neural network detector should appear
